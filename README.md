## Holoware help game development
Holoware contains 20 microgames and 3 boss stages. 
I cam study the existing microgames to get a sense of their structure.
It's really helpful for my game development.

To make the microgame in Holoware easlier to port to other game project, I want to make all Micro game to Unity package.
